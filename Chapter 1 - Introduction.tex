\section{Problem Statement}\label{sect:description}
\hspace{\parindent}

Managing finances can be a challenge for many people, especially for those who have never received proper education on financial management. Poor financial management can lead to debt, financial stress, and can negatively impact one's quality of life.

One of the biggest issues with money management is the lack of financial education. Many people have never been taught how to properly manage their finances, which can lead to poor spending habits, lack of savings, and accumulating debt. Without the proper knowledge and skills, it can be difficult to make informed financial decisions and plan for the future.

Another problem is that many people live beyond their means, which means they spend more money than they earn. This can lead to accumulating debt and struggling to make ends meet. Living beyond one's means can also prevent individuals from saving money for future expenses or emergencies.

Savings are important because they provide a safety net for unexpected expenses and can help individuals achieve their long-term financial goals. Having savings can also reduce financial stress and provide a sense of security. However, many people struggle with saving money due to a lack of financial education, living beyond their means, and not making saving a priority.

In conclusion, financial management is a crucial skill that everyone should learn. Proper financial education, living within one's means, and making saving a priority can help individuals avoid debt, reduce financial stress, and achieve their financial goals.
