\hspace{\parindent}In conclusion, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between Design Theory, Design Thinking, and Application Design. The goal is to foster a robust theoretical and practical understanding that will enable designers to create applications that not only fulfill functional requirements but also resonate with users and deliver outstanding experiences.


Design theory is a broad and multifaceted field that encompasses many different areas of study, including graphic design, web design, user experience design, and more.  At its core, design theory is concerned with the principles and elements that underlie all forms of visual communication and problem-solving.
Design thinking is an essential component of design theory, and we will examine how this problem-solving approach is used in design to empathize with users, generate ideas, and iterate on solutions.

\subsection{Spacing}
The importance of maintaining constant spacing in design cannot be overstated. Consistent spacing, often referred to as spacing guidelines or whitespace management, plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall visual appeal and readability of a design. It ensures that elements are properly organized, allowing users to navigate and comprehend the content more effectively.

Spacing guidelines provide a sense of balance, harmony, and hierarchy within the design. By establishing consistent margins, padding, and line spacing, designers can create a cohesive and structured layout. This consistency helps users understand the relationships between different elements and makes the design more intuitive to navigate.

Proper spacing also contributes to the overall usability and accessibility of the design. Sufficient spacing between interactive elements, such as buttons or links, allows for easier selection and reduces the chance of accidental clicks. It enhances the user experience by providing a comfortable and uncluttered interface, which improves user satisfaction and engagement.

In addition, consistent spacing contributes to the perception of professionalism and attention to detail. It reflects a well-thought-out design process and gives the impression of a polished product. It shows that the designer has considered the overall user experience and visual aesthetics.

To maintain constant spacing, designers often establish grid systems or use design tools that provide layout guides and alignment features. This ensures that elements are aligned properly and follow the defined spacing guidelines consistently throughout the design.





\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Margins}: Maintain consistent margins around the edges of the design layout. This ensures that the content is not too close to the edges, providing breathing space and preventing visual clutter.
  
  \item \textbf{Padding}: Apply consistent padding within elements to create visual separation and prevent content from feeling cramped. This includes padding around text, images, buttons, and other interactive elements.
  
  \item \textbf{Line spacing}: Use line spacing in text blocks to improve readability. Ensure that lines of text are adequately spaced to avoid overcrowding or excessive gaps, making the content more visually appealing and easier to read.
  
  \item \textbf{Element spacing}: Maintain consistent spacing between elements such as buttons, icons, images, and paragraphs. This helps create a balanced and organized layout, allowing users to navigate and interact with the design more intuitively.
  
  \item \textbf{Grid systems}: Use grid systems to establish a consistent layout structure. Grids help align elements and maintain consistent spacing throughout the design, contributing to a visually pleasing and harmonious composition.
  
  \item \textbf{Responsive design}: Consider spacing guidelines for different screen sizes and devices. Optimize spacing to ensure that elements are properly proportioned and readable across various resolutions and orientations.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Grids}
Grid systems are a fundamental tool in design that provides a framework for organizing and aligning elements within a layout. They comprise a series of vertical and horizontal lines that create a structured grid of intersecting points or cells.

Grids offer several benefits in design:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Consistency and Structure}: Grids provide a consistent structure for organizing content, creating a sense of order and hierarchy. They help maintain visual consistency across different screens and pages within a project.
  
  \item \textbf{Alignment}: Grids facilitate the precise alignment of elements, ensuring that they are visually harmonious. By aligning elements to the grid, designers can achieve a more polished and professional look.
  
  \item \textbf{Proportional Layouts}: Grids enable designers to create proportional layouts by dividing the spacebar into well-defined columns and rows. This allows for more efficient use of space and helps maintain a balanced visual composition.
  
  \item \textbf{Flexibility and Responsiveness}: Grids can be designed to be flexible, allowing for fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. By defining responsive breakpoints within the grid system, designers can ensure that the design remains cohesive and functional across various devices.
  
  \item \textbf{Efficiency and Workflow}: Grids provide a framework that streamlines the design process. They help designers make consistent decisions about spacing, sizing, and alignment, saving time and effort. Grid-based layouts also make it easier to maintain and update designs as the project evolves.
  
  \item \textbf{Visual Hierarchy}: Grids can establish a clear visual hierarchy within a design. By assigning different columns or rows different levels of importance, designers can guide the viewerâ€™s attention and emphasize key elements.
\end{enumerate}

Grid systems can be customized to suit the specific needs of a project. They can vary in terms of column widths, gutter sizes, and the number of subdivisions. Designers can choose between fixed grids, where the columns and gutters have predefined sizes, or fluid grids, which adapt to the screen space.

By incorporating grid systems into their design process, designers can create layouts that are visually pleasing, organized, and easy to navigate. Grids serve as a foundational tool that supports the overall structure and coherence of a design, enhancing both the aesthetics and functionality of the final product.

To integrate grids in our application, we can define a grid system with a specific number of columns and spacing between them. By aligning elements to this grid, we can ensure consistency and proper organization.
\cite{webdesignres}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Graphics/Design/Grids/image.png}
  \caption{Example of integrating grids in the application design}
  \label{fig:grid-example}
\end{figure}

In this example, we have implemented an 8-column grid system with a 4px baseline. The grid helps to align and structure various elements within the application's layout. Each column spans an equal width, and the baseline ensures consistent vertical spacing between elements.

By dividing the available space into eight columns, we create a proportional layout that can accommodate different components. The 4px baseline establishes a consistent vertical rhythm, ensuring that elements align harmoniously along the vertical axis.

The grid can guide the placement of elements such as text blocks, images, buttons, and other interactive components. By aligning these elements to the grid, we achieve a visually balanced and organized layout.

To ensure proper integration of the grid, designers can use design tools or frameworks that provide grid functionality. These tools assist in snapping elements to the grid and provide visual cues for aligning components accurately.

Integrating an 8-column, 4px baseline grid brings structure, consistency, and visual harmony to the application's design. It enhances readability, organization, and overall user experience. By following the grid guidelines, designers can create visually appealing and functional interfaces that resonate with users.

\hspace{\parindent} First of all the design is quite a complex step so I tried to iterate multiple designs. 
In the next Subsection I will describe my design motivation for this design and what are reasons why I had not continued with it.

\subsection{First Design Iteration}

When selecting colors for different transaction types in the application, a set of guidelines and considerations were followed. The primary aim was to ensure that the chosen colors were easily distinguishable. The colors were selected based on their association with the corresponding transaction types commonly recognized by users.

In the color selection for different transaction types in the application, the following associations were made:

Certainly! Here's the information presented in a list format using LaTeX code:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Income transactions: \textbf{Green} - commonly associated with money and growth.
  \item Expenses: \textbf{Red} - chosen due to its association with negative actions or consequences.
  \item Investing: \textbf{Yellow} or \textbf{gold} - symbolizing wealth and luxury.
  \item Savings: \textbf{Blue} - selected for its connotations of stability and reliability.
\end{itemize}


These color choices were made to ensure easy distinguishing ability and to align with the recognized associations of these colors by users.

It is important to note that, during the color selection process, the goal was to create a visually balanced composition that would enhance the application's overall usability and modernity. The chosen colors were carefully implemented to maintain simplicity while incorporating enough features. The resulting design layout, illustrated in the accompanying Figma file, showcases the successful execution of these principles.

Upon reflection, it was realized that some color compositions were uneven and required further changes to ensure a harmonious visual presentation.

\hspace{\parindent}Below, we provide some illustrations that showcase the design layout of the application. The illustrations demonstrate how the application has been developed to prioritize simplicity, usability, and modernity, with a balanced amount of features and a sleek design.

\subsection{Second Design Iteration}


\textit{Purple} was chosen as the primary color for the transaction menu, taking into consideration factors such as uniqueness and elegance. It was believed that \textit{purple} could add a touch of \textit{luxury, creativity, and sophistication} to the app, which is not commonly seen in financial apps.

To ensure cohesiveness, different shades of \textit{purple} were utilized to represent various transaction types. A lighter shade of \textit{purple} was assigned to income transactions, while a darker shade was designated for expenses. Additionally, the author considered using other colors, such as \textit{green} or \textit{blue}, to represent additional transaction types like savings or investing.

The author made sure that the chosen \textit{purple} color was easily distinguishable from other colors used in the app and did not clash with other elements on the screen. To achieve this, a color wheel or palette generator was employed to find complementary colors to use alongside \textit{purple}.

As part of the design process, a simple Profile Page was created for the application. The author found that the new design was a better fit for their desired simplistic approach and aligned well with their overall vision.


In this second design iteration, the application's color scheme was carefully chosen to create a visually appealing and cohesive user interface. The following images showcase various perennially designed templates that were incorporated into the application, enhancing its overall aesthetic and user experience. These design templates provide consistent styling and layout for key components such as buttons, forms, and cards, creating a unified and professional look throughout the application.
